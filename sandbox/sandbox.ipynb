An \\nadventure needs to account for the different players and \\ncharacters in your group, drawing them into the story as \\neffectively as possible. \\nAs a starting point, think about your adventure in \\nterms of the three basic types of activity in the game: \\nexploration, social interaction, and combat. If your \\nadventure includes a balance of all three, it's likely to \\nappeal to all types of players. \\nAn adventure you create for your home campaign \\ndoesn't have to appeal to every abstract player type\\xad\\nonly to the players sitting down at your own table.

For example, the exploration of a ruined castle \\non a hill might lead to the discovery of a dragon's tomb \\nhidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness \\nmight lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only \\non nights of the full moon.

Random encounters \\ncan remind the players of the major themes of the \\ncampaign. For example, if your campaign features an \\nongoing war between two nations, you might design \\nrandom encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present \\nnature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables \\nmight include bedraggled troops returning from bat\\xad\\ntle, refugees fleeing invading forces, heavily guarded \\ncaravans full of weapons, and lone messengers on \\nhorseback riding for the front lines.
