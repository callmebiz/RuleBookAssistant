It appears that there is no provided context for your question about how resting works. Without specific information or text to refer to, I can give a general explanation.

Resting is a state where the body and mind are not engaged in physical or mental activity. It allows for recovery, rejuvenation, and maintenance of biological processes. During rest, the body lowers its metabolic rate, conserves energy, and engages in repair processes such as muscle recovery, tissue repair, and memory consolidation in the brain.
