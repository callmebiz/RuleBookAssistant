to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total 
number of them. For example, if a character has eight 
Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon 
finishing a long rest.
A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest 
in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 
1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
B e t w e e n A d v e n t u r e s
Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient 
evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and 
prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also 
use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting 
arms and armor, performing research, or spending 
their hard-earned gold.
In some cases, the passage of time is something that 
occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting 
a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a 
certain amount of time has passed and allow you to

every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social 
interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to 
sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds 
and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for 
further adventure.
Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an 
adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.
Short R est
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, 
during which a character does nothing more strenuous 
than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.
A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end 
of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number 
of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For 
each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die 
and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The 
character regains hit points equal to the total. The player 
can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. 
A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing
