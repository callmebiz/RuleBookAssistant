6. EXTINCTION OR DEPLETION 
Something that once existed in the campaign world 
is gone. The lost resource might be a precious metal, 
a species of plant or animal that held an important 
place in the local ecology, or an entire race or culture of 
people. Its absence causes a chain reaction that affects 
every creature that uses or relies on it. 
You can eliminate a people, place, or thing that 
previously existed in a certain location or area in your 
campaign world. On a small scale, the last of a family 
. dynasty passes away or a once-thriving mining town 
in the region dries up and becomes a ghost town. On a 
grand scale, magic dies, the last dragon is slain, or the 
final fey noble departs the world.

A character can spend time between adventures 
building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the 
character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies 
within a kingdom or similar domain , the character 
will need a royal charter (a legal document granting 
permission to oversee the estate in the name of the 
crown), a land grant (a legal docum ent bequeathing 
custody of the land to the character for as long as he 
or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal 
document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can 
also be acquired by inheritance or other means.
