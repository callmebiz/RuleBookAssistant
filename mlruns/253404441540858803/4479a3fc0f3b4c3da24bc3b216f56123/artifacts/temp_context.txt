of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, 
case, or other container is part of the attack. At the 
end of the battle, you can recover half your expended 
ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, 
reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are 
most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or 
a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it 
effectively can mean the difference between life and 
death while adventuring.
The Weapons table shows the most common weapons 
used in the worlds of D&D, their price and weight, 
the damage they deal when they hit, and any special 
properties they possess. Every weapon is classified 
as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to 
attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged 
weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including 
swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized 
training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial 
weapons because these weapons put their fighting style 
and training to best use.
Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your 
proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you 
make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using 
a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not 
add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, 
as shown in the Weapons table.
Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the 
ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if 
you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each 
time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece 
of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, 
case, or other container is part of the attack. At the 
end of the battle, you can recover half your expended

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property 
to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an 
improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in 
the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage 
when used in this way.
Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse 
weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or 
Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You 
must use the same modifier for both rolls.
Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack 
rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and 
bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use 
effectively.
Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, 
making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. 
See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
Loading. Because of the time required to load this 
weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition 
from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction 
to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can 
normally make.

threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need 
to prove yourself might all have been factors.
You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s 
army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war 
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. 
Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. 
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits 
of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family 
tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and 
armor? They might have been military issue or family 
heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years
to buy them. Your armaments are now among your 
most important possessions—the only things that stand 
between you and death’s embrace.
