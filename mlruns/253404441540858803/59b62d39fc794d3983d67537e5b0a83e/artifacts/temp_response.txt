To determine if a weapon is good in D&D, you should consider several factors outlined in the Player's Handbook:

1. **Proficiency**: Weapons are classified as martial and simple. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll, making it generally more effective in your hands (Player's Handbook, page 136).

2. **Weapon Properties**: Each weapon has specific properties that might enhance its effectiveness in different scenarios. For instance, some weapons have properties such as:
   - **Ammunition**: Ranged weapons require ammo and can allow for recovery of expended ammunition after battles.
   - **Range**: The normal range and maximum range of a weapon are critical to assess its effectiveness in combat.
   - **Reach**: Some weapons provide additional range in close combat, allowing you to attack from further away.
   - **Special**: Some weapons have unique rules, enhancing their utility in specific situations (Player's Handbook, page 137).

3. **Type of Weapon**: Consider if the weapon is melee or ranged. Depending on your character's build (e.g., focusing on Strength or Dexterity), different types of weapons will suit your play style better (Player's Handbook, page 136).

4. **Damage**: Examine the damage output listed in the Weapons table. More powerful weapons generally deal higher damage, significantly influencing their overall effectiveness in battles.

5. **Class Compatibility**: Different classes grant proficiency with different weapons. Choose a weapon that aligns with your class abilities to maximize effectiveness (Player's Handbook, page 136).

In summary, a weapon's goodness can be assessed through its proficiency with your character, its special properties, damage output, and how well it complements your character's class and play style.
